# MeadMate

MeadMate (a.k.a. "Simalaskuri" in finnish) is a small web page for calculating appropriate amount of sugar, water etc. for fermenting mead. The motivation for creating this was partly to get to know the chemical reactions, partly to get a proper calculator for my own needs and partly to learn to use bootstrap, jquery and responsive web design.
